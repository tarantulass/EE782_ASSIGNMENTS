2025-10-13 22:45:00 [INFO] Governer returned level: Based on the escalation levels:

1. The first interaction with Arbaaz indicates a level of 1 (politely requesting identification and purpose).
2. The second interaction with Abbas shows a level of 2 (repeatedly asking for details without complying to leave).
3. The third interaction with Maibash suggests a level of 1, as he's also asking for identification but is being cooperative.
4. Lastly, the shutdown from "Maibash" indicates an escalation to level 3 (misbehavior and threat).
